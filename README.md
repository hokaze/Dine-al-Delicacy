# Dine-al Delicacy
Assistant tool for Gourmet class from the Fabula Ultima Natural Fantasy Atlas.

Early proof-of-concept. Not yet functional.

Intent is to function as a "cookbook" for the delicacy mechanics of the Gourmet class, including automating the randomised effects of first combining ingredients, buying/finding random ingredients, and to track ingredient usage.

Dine-al Delicacy is not to be confused with any near-rhyme franchises that uses alliterative Fs instead of alliterative Ds.
